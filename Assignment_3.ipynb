    "Explain with an example each when to use a for loop and a while loop?\n",
    "Ans: For loops are used when you have a known number of iterations or when you want to iterate through a sequence (list, tuple, string, etc.) to perform an action for each item in the sequence.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "# print the numbers 0 to 9\n",
    "for i in range(10):\n",
    "    print(i)\n",
    "While loops are used when you want to keep executing a block of code as long as a certain condition is met.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "# print the numbers 0 to 9\n",
    "i = 0\n",
    "while i < 10:\n",
    "    print(i)\n",
    "    i += 1\n",
    "It is important to keep in mind that while loops can lead to infinite loops if the termination condition is never met, so it's crucial to make sure that the condition eventually becomes false."
